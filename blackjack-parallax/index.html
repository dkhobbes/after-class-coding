        <p>So why should we use this syntax and why is it valid? We must set the div to the fixed position so that the image background remains fixed. Secondly we set the width to 100% to cover the document and set the height a little larger to compensate for the scrolled effect. Next we set the top and left positions to 0 so that the background image is set to top left. After this syntax is applied you can set the background image you would like to have a scroll effect for.</p>
        <h3>The JQuery</h3>
        <p>Like the Css there is not much to expect for the Jquery the syntax is simple and completes the parallax effect so that you can start creating amazing looking pages! </p>
        <p>For the JQuery we will be using the Jquery Scroll Function. First we create a new function which is called parallax. In this function we create a variable which is equal to the top of the browser window. Last but not least we change the css so the when the window is scrolled the background image in negatively scrolled by a certain amount of pixels. This effect can be sped up or slowed down.</p>
